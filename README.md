Implementing Denotational Semantics of a Functional-Logic Language and a Functional Language with Sets
======================================================================================================

This repository contains my bachelor thesis and related code.
I am going to implement the denotational semantics of the CuMin and SaLT languages described in 
[Parametricity and Proving Free Theorems for Functional-Logic Languages](http://www.janis-voigtlaender.eu/MSSV14.html) 
using Haskell. The groundwork needed for the implementation, i.e. parsers, 
type-checkers etc. are only a minor part of the thesis and thus these components are located in 
[another](https://github.com/fatho/ba-funlogic-common) repository
